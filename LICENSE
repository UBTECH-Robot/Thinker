Dual License Agreement for Thinker Model (Free for Non-Commercial Use + Commercial Use Requires Authorization)

This Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement") is formulated by the copyright owner of the Thinker model (hereinafter referred to as the "Model") [UBTECH Robotics] (hereinafter referred to as the "Licensor"), and shall apply to all individuals or organizations that obtain and use the Model (hereinafter referred to as the "Licensee").

Core Statement: The Model is fine-tuned based on the Qwen3 base weights (copyright owned by the Qwen Team), and the Qwen3 base weights are subject to the Apache License 2.0. As a derivative work, the Model adopts a "Dual License" mechanism, meaning it may be freely used for non-commercial purposes, while commercial use requires separate permission from the Licensor. At the same time, the core obligations and attribution requirements of the Apache License 2.0 must be complied with throughout.

I. Source of Base Weights and Obligations under the Original Agreement

1. The base weights of the Model are derived from the Qwen3 model (official repository: https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3). The copyright of the Qwen3 base weights is owned by the Qwen Team and is subject to the Apache License 2.0 (see Appendix 1 of this Agreement for the complete text).

2. When using the Model, the Licensee must fully comply with the core obligations of the Apache License 2.0, including but not limited to:

- Retain all contents of the original Qwen3 copyright notice, patent license notice, and NOTICE file without modification or deletion;

- If making secondary modifications to the Model, clearly mark "Modified" along with the modification date and content in the modified files;

- Provide the complete text of this Agreement and the Apache License 2.0 to any third party receiving the Model.

II. Core Rules of Dual License

The right to use the Model is divided into two categories based on the usage scenario: "Non-Commercial Use" and "Commercial Use". The specific rules are as follows:

(I) Authorization for Non-Commercial Use

1. Scope of Authorization: The Licensee may freely obtain, use, modify, and redistribute the Model (including fine-tuned derivative weights) for non-commercial and non-profit purposes without prior application for authorization from the Licensor.

2. Definition of Non-Commercial Use: Refers to usage for academic research, personal learning, or public welfare purposes, excluding any behavior aimed at directly or indirectly obtaining commercial interests. Examples include:

- Using the Model for the development and sale of commercial products (e.g., embedding in paid software, paid cloud service interfaces, etc.);

- Using the Model for commercial advertising, marketing promotion, or related services;

- Providing paid consulting, training, or deployment services based on the Model to third parties;

- Other profit-oriented usage behaviors.

1. Additional Obligations for Non-Commercial Use: When using or redistributing the Model for non-commercial purposes, the Licensee must mark the complete attribution information in a prominent location (e.g., project README, product description document) (see Article 3 of this Agreement for specific requirements).

(II) Authorization for Commercial Use

1. Principle of Authorization: For commercial use of the Model, the Licensee must submit a written application to the Licensor in advance and obtain a "Commercial Authorization Certificate". Unauthorized commercial use will entitle the Licensor to pursue legal liability.

2. Application Process for Commercial Authorization:

- The Licensee shall send an application email to the Licensor's designated email address [Your Commercial Authorization Application Email], with the subject line marked "Application for Commercial Authorization of Qwen3 Fine-Tuned Model";

- The application materials shall include: full name of the enterprise/organization, unified social credit code (individual commercial users shall provide ID number), detailed description of the usage scenario, estimated usage scale (e.g., number of users, number of deployment nodes), and duration of commercial use;

- The Licensor will review the application within 3 working days upon receipt. Upon approval, the Licensor will sign a "Commercial Authorization Certificate" with the Licensee, specifying the scope of authorization, authorization fee, rights and obligations, and liability for breach of contract;

- The Licensee may commercially use the Model within the authorized scope only after paying the corresponding authorization fee and completing the signing of the "Commercial Authorization Certificate".

1. Additional Restrictions on Commercial Authorization:

- The scope of commercial use shall not exceed the scenario agreed in the "Commercial Authorization Certificate". To expand the scope of use, a separate application is required;

- The Licensee must mark the basic source of the Model (Qwen3) and the information of the fine-tuning Licensor in the description document of the commercial product/service;

- If the Licensee uses the Model for commercial redistribution (e.g., providing products containing the Model to its customers), it must ensure that its customers also comply with the relevant requirements of this Agreement and the "Commercial Authorization Certificate".

III. Mandatory Attribution Requirements

Regardless of the usage scenario (non-commercial/authorized commercial), the Licensee must mark the following attribution information in a prominent location (e.g., project homepage, product manual, acknowledgment section of academic papers) when using, modifying, or redistributing the Model, without omission or modification:

Base Model: Qwen3 (https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen), subject to the Apache License 2.0, copyright owned by the Qwen Team;
Fine-Tuned Model: [Your Model Name] (https://Your Project Repository Link), fine-tuned based on Qwen3 by [Your Name/Organization Name];
License Agreement: Dual License Agreement for Qwen3 Fine-Tuned Model (Free for Non-Commercial Use + Commercial Use Requires Authorization), see https://Your Agreement Hosting Link for details;
Dataset Source: Trained on the GUI-World dataset (if applicable, supplementary dataset official link and copyright information may be added).

IV. Other Core Restrictions

1. The Licensee shall not use the Model for any illegal, irregular, or public order-disrupting scenarios, including but not limited to: malicious cyber attacks, disinformation generation, infringement of others' privacy/intellectual property rights, endangering national security, etc. In the event of such behavior, the Licensor has the right to terminate the authorization, and the Licensee shall bear full legal liability.

2. For derivative weights generated by secondary modifications to the Model, the Licensee must adopt the "Dual License" mechanism of this Agreement, and shall not independently change the authorization method to "completely prohibit commercial use" or "unrestricted commercial use". At the same time, the original attribution information and the text of this Agreement must be retained.

3. The Licensor makes no express or implied warranties regarding the applicability, accuracy, or safety of the Model. The Licensor shall not be liable for any direct or indirect losses incurred by the Licensee due to the use of the Model.

4. The conclusion, performance, interpretation, and dispute resolution of this Agreement shall all be governed by the laws of the People's Republic of China (for overseas organizations/individuals as Licensees, the governing law agreed by both parties shall apply). Any dispute arising from this Agreement shall first be resolved through friendly negotiation between both parties; if negotiation fails, it shall be submitted to the people's court with jurisdiction for litigation.

V. Effectiveness and Modification of the Agreement

1. This Agreement shall take effect from the date the Licensee obtains the Model and remain valid until the expiration of the copyright protection period of the Model.

2. The Licensor has the right to modify this Agreement in accordance with changes in laws and regulations, updates to the original Qwen3 agreement, or actual business needs. The modified Agreement shall be publicly posted in a prominent location of the project repository and shall take effect 30 days after the posting date. If the Licensee continues to use the Model, it shall be deemed to have recognized the content of the modified Agreement.
